If you take the cooridnates of two opposite corners of the image and input
them to `x1, x2, y1, y2`, and configure the `x_step` and `y_step` depending 
on your zoom level (make a little bit of overlap per step to make the stitching
programs job easier), and set `delay` to the integration time of the image, 
and lastly set up image auto numbering and removal of all extra artefacts (scale
bars and such) this script will take the full grid of images specified by those 
parameters on the Hitachi SU3500.
